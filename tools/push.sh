# push.sh — get commits to GitHub, and never decide "no" by accident.
#
# WHY THIS IS ITS OWN FILE
# ------------------------
# Both ckpt.sh and autosave.sh need to answer "is there anything to push?"
# cheaply, because autosave runs after every single tool call and a no-op
# network round trip on each one is latency paid hundreds of times a session
# for nothing.
#
# The obvious test — `git rev-list --count @{u}..HEAD` — has a failure mode
# that cost this repo a checkpoint the day it was written. `@{u}` needs a
# remote-TRACKING ref (refs/remotes/origin/main). A checkout whose branch was
# created from FETCH_HEAD has branch.main.remote and branch.main.merge set,
# looks completely normal to `git remote show`, and still has no such ref — so
# `@{u}` errors, the `|| echo 0` fallback reads as "nothing to push", and the
# push is skipped in silence. The commit is made, the session reports success,
# and the work never leaves the container. On a usage cap that is total loss.
#
# So the rule here: when the count cannot be determined, PUSH. A wasted push
# costs a second; a skipped one costs the session.
