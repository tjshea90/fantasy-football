#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# The job is worked across three Claude accounts. When one runs out of usage,
# the next one opens this repo COLD: no memory of the conversation, no idea a
# previous session existed. Everything it needs has to already be on disk and
# has to arrive without Tj typing an explanation, because the whole point is
# that he does not have to remember one.
#
# So this prints the briefing into the new session's context automatically:
# where the last session stopped (CHECKPOINT.md), what the job is (TASKS.md),
# the rules that must not be broken, and — the part bootstrap.sh cannot know —
# whether this checkout is actually current with GitHub, and whether the
# automatic checkpointing was still working when the last session died.
#
# BUDGET. bootstrap.sh was deliberately cut from ~1,200 lines to ~120 because
# everything printed here is re-sent on every subsequent turn. Do not grow this
# without reading the note at the top of bootstrap.sh first.
