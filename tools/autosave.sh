#
# WHY THIS IS NOT ckpt.sh
# -----------------------
# ckpt.sh is the DELIBERATE checkpoint: it runs every suite, and it rewrites
# CHECKPOINT.md with "what I just did" and "what comes next" — the two things
# no diff can reconstruct. It needs a session that knows its own intent.
#
# This runs from a hook, after every file edit and every bash command, with no
# idea what the session is trying to do. So it does the opposite:
#   - no test run (it fires constantly; it must take milliseconds)
#   - it NEVER touches CHECKPOINT.md — overwriting a real "Do this next" with
#     an invented one would destroy the exact thing the next session needs
#   - no gate of any kind: a broken half-edit that is COMMITTED is recoverable,
#     the same half-edit uncommitted dies with the session
#
# It exists for one failure: the usage cap landing mid-change. Everything up to
# the last completed tool call is already on GitHub when that happens.
#
# ALWAYS exits 0. A checkpoint that breaks the session it is protecting is
# worse than no checkpoint.
