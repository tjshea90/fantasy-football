# CHECKPOINT 127 — read me first, then TASKS.md

**Written:** 2026-09-12T06:14:20Z · **version:** 5.2 · **tests:** all 13 suites green

## Just done
branch-reconciliation job complete and archived: moved the 2026-09-12b request (8/8 items) into LADDER.md section 20 with what proves each one, reset TASKS.md to the no-active-job placeholder. Re-recorded the still-open main-fast-forward/stale-branch-deletion question under Waiting on Tj since he deferred it until this merge shipped.

## Do this next
waiting on Tj to confirm v5.2 on the phone and to answer the repo-cleanup question now that the merge is done

## How to resume, exactly
Open this GitHub repo in a Claude Code session on ANY of the three
accounts and say "continue". The SessionStart hook runs tools/resume.sh,
which pulls the latest and prints this file automatically — nothing has
to be attached, uploaded or explained. If that briefing did not appear,
run it by hand:
```bash
bash tools/resume.sh       # pull + this file + TASKS.md + the rules
```
Then continue from **Do this next** above. Do not re-plan, do not re-read
finished work, do not ask Tj to re-explain anything — `TASKS.md` carries his
request in his own words and `git log` carries every step already taken.

(2 automatic checkpoint(s) since the last deliberate one — the
session was still mid-step. `git diff` against it shows what changed.)
