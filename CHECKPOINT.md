# CHECKPOINT 94 — read me first, then TASKS.md

**Written:** 2026-09-23T03:51:56Z · **version:** 8.3 · **tests:** all 22 suites green

## Just done
v8.3 Release published and verified (get_release_by_tag v8.3: FFTracker-v8.3.apk, 334102 bytes, not a draft). 2026-09-23 job complete: speed pass, closing-sync bug fix, UI polish; major ideas 1-7 await Tj under Waiting on Tj.

## Do this next
Nothing in flight. Next: whatever Tj picks from proposals 1-7 in TASKS.md 'Waiting on Tj' (or a light/full test per CLAUDE.md). Re-measure any future speed work with node tools/perf.js (build a real-data state with --sync 1,2 --save F).

## How to resume, exactly
Open this GitHub repo in a Claude Code session on ANY of the three
accounts and say "continue". The SessionStart hook runs tools/resume.sh,
which pulls the latest and prints this file automatically — nothing has
to be attached, uploaded or explained. If that briefing did not appear,
run it by hand:
```bash
bash tools/resume.sh       # pull + this file + TASKS.md + the rules
```
Then continue from **Do this next** above. Do not re-plan, do not re-read
finished work, do not ask Tj to re-explain anything — `TASKS.md` carries his
request in his own words and `git log` carries every step already taken.
