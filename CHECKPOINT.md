# CHECKPOINT 53 — read me first, then TASKS.md

**Written:** 2026-09-24T17:51:40Z · **version:** 8.5 · **tests:** all 23 suites green

## Just done
Wrote Tj's 2026-09-24 'full test + what other popular FF apps have (incl. UI/appearance)' into TASKS.md as steps 1-10; archived the 10 finished jobs (2026-09-18b..23c) from TASKS.md to LADDER.md §42 (TASKS.md 1051 -> 421 lines).

## Do this next
Step 1: floor (every test_*.js + check_es2018.js by exit code AND output), then step 2 static cross-checks.

## How to resume, exactly
Open this GitHub repo in a Claude Code session on ANY of the three
accounts and say "continue". The SessionStart hook runs tools/resume.sh,
which pulls the latest and prints this file automatically — nothing has
to be attached, uploaded or explained. If that briefing did not appear,
run it by hand:
```bash
bash tools/resume.sh       # pull + this file + TASKS.md + the rules
```
Then continue from **Do this next** above. Do not re-plan, do not re-read
finished work, do not ask Tj to re-explain anything — `TASKS.md` carries his
request in his own words and `git log` carries every step already taken.

(2 automatic checkpoint(s) since the last deliberate one — the
session was still mid-step. `git diff` against it shows what changed.)
