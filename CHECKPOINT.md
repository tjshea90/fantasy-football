# CHECKPOINT 128 — read me first, then TASKS.md

**Written:** 2026-09-23T06:09:53Z · **version:** 8.4 · **tests:** all 23 suites green

## Just done
Full test steps 1-2 done: floor 23/23 green; CSS cross-check clean; fixed 6 stale 'Data → X' pointers in UI copy + new resolving test in test_boot.js (fails on v8.4).

## Do this next
Step 3: add a --crawl mode to tools/perf.js that taps every button/select on every tab + Lineups>Advice + Data sub-screens + dialogs (cancelling destructive confirms), collecting page errors and 'This screen hit an error' cards; run on the scratchpad real-data state.

## How to resume, exactly
Open this GitHub repo in a Claude Code session on ANY of the three
accounts and say "continue". The SessionStart hook runs tools/resume.sh,
which pulls the latest and prints this file automatically — nothing has
to be attached, uploaded or explained. If that briefing did not appear,
run it by hand:
```bash
bash tools/resume.sh       # pull + this file + TASKS.md + the rules
```
Then continue from **Do this next** above. Do not re-plan, do not re-read
finished work, do not ask Tj to re-explain anything — `TASKS.md` carries his
request in his own words and `git log` carries every step already taken.

(2 automatic checkpoint(s) since the last deliberate one — the
session was still mid-step. `git diff` against it shows what changed.)
