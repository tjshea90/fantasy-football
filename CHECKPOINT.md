# CHECKPOINT 52 — read me first, then TASKS.md

**Written:** 2026-09-23T03:06:27Z · **version:** 8.2 · **tests:** all 22 suites green

## Just done
Wrote Tj's 2026-09-23 request (polish/reorganize/declutter + make it snappy on the Moto G 2026) into TASKS.md as steps A-H.

## Do this next
Step A: baseline suites. Then B: measure boot + per-tab render in throttled headless Chromium with a stubbed Native bridge before changing anything.

## How to resume, exactly
Open this GitHub repo in a Claude Code session on ANY of the three
accounts and say "continue". The SessionStart hook runs tools/resume.sh,
which pulls the latest and prints this file automatically — nothing has
to be attached, uploaded or explained. If that briefing did not appear,
run it by hand:
```bash
bash tools/resume.sh       # pull + this file + TASKS.md + the rules
```
Then continue from **Do this next** above. Do not re-plan, do not re-read
finished work, do not ask Tj to re-explain anything — `TASKS.md` carries his
request in his own words and `git log` carries every step already taken.

(1 automatic checkpoint(s) since the last deliberate one — the
session was still mid-step. `git diff` against it shows what changed.)
