# CHECKPOINT 85 — read me first, then TASKS.md

**Written:** 2026-09-18T20:43:12Z · **version:** 7.7 · **tests:** all 21 suites green

## Just done
ship: v7.8: waiver wire repaired — the false season-ending flag, the impossible count, and same-position drops

## Do this next
verify on the phone

## How to resume, exactly
Open this GitHub repo in a Claude Code session on ANY of the three
accounts and say "continue". The SessionStart hook runs tools/resume.sh,
which pulls the latest and prints this file automatically — nothing has
to be attached, uploaded or explained. If that briefing did not appear,
run it by hand:
```bash
bash tools/resume.sh       # pull + this file + TASKS.md + the rules
```
Then continue from **Do this next** above. Do not re-plan, do not re-read
finished work, do not ask Tj to re-explain anything — `TASKS.md` carries his
request in his own words and `git log` carries every step already taken.

(4 automatic checkpoint(s) since the last deliberate one — the
session was still mid-step. `git diff` against it shows what changed.)
