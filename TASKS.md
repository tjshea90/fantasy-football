# TASKS — the current job, in Tj's words

**There is no active job right now.** The 2026-09-14e request (auto-select
the current NFL week, stop showing stale cached projections on Advice, drop
preseason data from advice/recommendations, blend more rescored projection
sources for my roster + this week's opponent, and show injury/questionable
status everywhere my players are listed) is complete and archived at the end
of `LADDER.md` (§27).

## When Tj asks for something new

Write it HERE FIRST, in his own words, as unticked boxes — before writing any
code. Until it is on disk the job exists only in a chat window that no other
Claude account can see, and a usage cap landing before the first checkpoint
loses not just the work but the knowledge of what was asked.

```
# TASKS — the <date> request, in Tj's words

> "<paste what he actually said, verbatim>"

- [ ] 1a. <first step>
- [ ] 1b. <second step>
```

Ticking a box means: written, tested, committed, and the test that proves it is
named in the box. **Never tick a box you have not verified** — the next account
will not re-check it.

When a job is finished, move it to `LADDER.md` and reset this file. This file
is printed into every session briefing, so a finished job left here is re-read
at cost on every cold start, forever.

## Waiting on Tj

- [ ] **Confirm the v5.7 GitHub Release link downloads cleanly**:
      ```
      https://github.com/tjshea90/fantasy-football/releases/tag/v5.7
      ```
      Fully verified server-side (real Release, asset uploaded, correct
      content type, `Content-Disposition: attachment` on the download) —
      just needs a real-device confirmation. From here on, every future
      ship sends this style of link automatically (see CLAUDE.md "After
      every ship").
- [ ] **Confirm today's (2026-09-14e) changes on the phone** once the new
      version is shipped and its Release link arrives: the app should open
      straight on the current NFL week; the Advice tab should show a clear
      "projections have not loaded yet" card (not old numbers) right after
      switching to a week that has not been synced, and pulling down on
      Advice should visibly run the full advice sync; the new "[opponent] ·
      blended projections" card should appear on Advice under your own
      bench; and OUT/DOUBTFUL/QUESTIONABLE tags should now show next to
      players on the Rosters, Lineups and Live tabs, not just Advice.
- [ ] **Confirm v5.6's injury-freshness fix on the phone** (still open from
      §24): the Wire tab's "Your roster — injuries" card should show a
      freshness line and its own "Sync injury feed" button, and "Ask Claude
      about the wire" should read current news now.
- [ ] **Confirm the v5.5 waiver-wire upgrade itself** (still open from §23):
      SEASON/1-WEEK tags, the "Last game" stat line under "why ▾", K/DEF
      only appearing when actually needed, and the "Add + drop" combined
      action on a real pickup.
- [ ] Delete stale branches himself — no session yet has had branch-delete
      access (checked repeatedly, a real permission boundary, not a bug to
      retry): `android-app-nav-ui-refactor-os6q53`,
      `resume-logic-claude-code-2ye25r`, `live-tab-dual-scores-h2nxyf` (see
      LADDER.md §22e), plus one new one from an earlier session's testing,
      `test-branch-scope-check` (harmless diagnostic branch, safe to
      delete, never had real work on it).
- [ ] Decide whether to get a pay-as-you-go Anthropic API key now that the
      Claude-Pro-subscription question is settled (§25) — if not, the
      "Or use the Claude app" handoff on both the Advice and Wire tabs stays
      the zero-cost path, just with the manual export/import step.
- [ ] Consider whether a genuinely reputable, free, no-key third projection
      source ever turns up (NFL.com, FantasyPros, Yahoo and MFL were all
      checked and rejected today — see LADDER.md §27 / STATE.md for why).
      If Tj is willing to sign up for a paid/keyed data provider, that
      changes the calculus and is worth revisiting.
